This is an implementation of [this assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card) from The Odin Project.

Uses the [Pexels](https://pexels.com) API to fetch images. Has bare-bones API error handling, because it predates the Odin lessons on React error handling.

This was my first time using environment variables.
